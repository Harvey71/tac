TAC-Board in a case - for 6 or 4 players

TAC is a really great board game with a strong community. You can buy boards for 6 or for 4 players, together with the balls, cards and game instructions. Unfortunately, the boards are expensive and quite large. Luckily, they also provide a creative set with everything you need, except the board. This made me make a tiled version - for 6 and 4 players - in a case. And I made a [video](https://youtu.be/oRSwn_ET9Ro) about it.

In this repository you will find all files you need to reproduce it. You would also need:
- A laser cutter/engraver, like the snapmaker A350T with 40W module. But any laser cutter with 10W or more should suffice. It just have to go through 5-6 mm plywood.
- 5-6 mm plywood (US: https://amzn.to/3BDdOwk D: https://amzn.to/3DEe3rm *)
- 3 mm MDF board (US: https://amzn.to/4gI6YV9 D: https://amzn.to/4fq6QbH *)
- The TAC creative set, of course (https://shop.spiel-tac.de/TACreativeset-big-german). Use the one with the 16mm marbles!
- A neat wooden case 380 x 270 x 90 mm (US: ? D: https://amzn.to/3VLX4tK *)
- Some convoluted foam (US: https://amzn.to/402ssXl D: https://amzn.to/41HkdkN *)
